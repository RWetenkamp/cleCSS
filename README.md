# cleCSS
To be honest: When it comes to large web projects, I'm messing around while coding and build very chaotic code files, especially the stylesheets.
That's the purpose of cleCSS: To keep your CSS files clean and organized!

Up to now I've implemented the following features:
- Seperation by selectors
- alphabetic sorting

What are your ideas? What functions would be cool? I'm very interested in your ideas!
